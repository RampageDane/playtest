          <p>Hello there and welcome to Dane Kubicka's portfolio, I'm Dane and I would like to tell you a little about myself and the intentions of this website.
            I am a student in many forms, but mostly within the range of Web Development and Video Game Design. I am always learning new things and am always
            excited to express what it is I'm currently working on. In order to put my projects out into the world for others to see, and to also let others
            interact with say content, this site is devoted to new and ever growing content that can be interactive, and also seen throughout development postings
            through the blog page. Thank you for coming to this site, and I hope you stay along for the ride!</p>
