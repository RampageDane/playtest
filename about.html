          <p>Playtest is a Podcast that looks into the life and projects of Video Game Developers and where they find theirselves today. With so many creative people out there today, it is
          interesting to listen to their unique ideas and creative projects that explore the questions we have when it comes to creating for such a medium.
        Being so interested in the development of Video Games, I have always been curious about the way such projects take shape. There are stories, articles, and even documentaries that have delved
      deep into the production of games and what it is to make one. While there are some great podcasts out there today that are fantastic (Tone Control, Game Maker's Notebook, and Designer Notes to name a few),
    I still feel that there still isn't enough personal stories on what it is to make these games that actually move people. I hope with those who are interested, and hopefull others who
 stumble upon Playtest, that they will consider playing the games we are talking about, and hopefully grow interested in such a wonderful industry and art form that is Video Games.</p>
